# Polymorphism-->many forms

#Built in polymorphic function
print(len("Sohag"))# len()---> is counting length of string
print(len([10,20,30,40]))# len()---> is counting length of  list


#user defined polymorphic function
def add(x, y, z=0, a=0): # intention of z value--> if z value is passed then it counts 0
    return x+y+z+a

print(add(20,30)) # as we pass two value then it will calculated 20+30+0=50
print(add(20,30,40)) # as we pass three value then it will calculated 20+30+40=90-->z value will be replaced by 40
print(add(20,30,40,50)) # as we pass three value then it will calculated 20+30+40=90-->z value will be replaced by 40
