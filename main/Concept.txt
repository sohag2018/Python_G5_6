****
In Python, it is not necessary to define the main function every time you write a program.
This is because the Python interpreter executes from the top of the file unless a specific function is defined.
Hence, having a defined starting point for the execution of your Python program is useful to better understand
how your program works.

****
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")
    if __name__== "__main__" :
main()
In the above example, you can see, there is a function called ‘main()’. This is followed by a conditional ‘if’ statement
that checks the value of __name__, and compares it to the string “__main__“. On evaluation to True, it executes main().

****
Python has a special built-in variable, called __name__. This variable gets assigned the string “__main__” depending on
how you are running or executing the script.
if you are running the script directly, Python is going to assign “__main__” to __name__, i.e., __name__= “__main__”.
(This happens in the background).
In short, __name__ variable helps you to check if the file is being run directly or if it has been imported.
